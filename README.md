# Password-Generator-Storage-with-a-GUI
This is a password generator as well as an app that stores passwords to the websites you type into it. It uses the GUI standard library tkinter, and involves different data files to store said passwords and accounts. This incorporates JSON for transferring data as well as storing the passwords for future use when needed, dictionaries, functions, and error handling. 
You can search for a password if you forgot it, you can generate a new random password for any website, and you can add a website paired with a password to the JSON file to store it so you can access it when needed.
